# LoanFinder
Welcome to the Loan Finder application !
Finding a real estate loan these days can be tricky, so we propose this small app to help you out. 


Will it make your financial situation any better ? Probably not ...
Nevertheless, we propose this tiny app on terminal to find loans that you are elligible to apply to. Test it out !


NB: The database used here is made out of fictive data, used only for developpement, ideally linking this app to a broader dynamic database would acutally allow the app to be fully usable.

## How does that work?

Basically, any organisation providing loans to individuals will look for several things before coming to a conclusion wether or not it will issue a loan or not. 

Roughly: the biggest factors will be concerning the loan amount, the home value, how much monney you make and how much you already spend on debt repayment.
